    .SYNOPSIS

		Demonstrates how to manipulate git via PoSH.

		Based on a given starting folder this will do a git fetch/merge against all subfolders/projects.
		If you are like me you probably have tens of git repos you use daily.  In many cases only a few
		of those you actually make changes to.  For the others you really just want to fetch/merge for
		origin/master, probably daily.

		This script does that for Windows.  It uses posh-git for all git manipulations, but this script
		will install posh-git if needed.

		posh-git:  https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git


	.REQUIRES
		msysgit (you should have that already).
		post-git module (this script will download and install it if required)
	.DESCRIPTION
		See the synopsis.
		Hardcoded to the local machine only.
		$RootFolder is set in the code, but can be parameterized.
		Almost no error-handling.  This was written for me and I don't make mistakes.  This script
		can certainly be improved upon, modularized, etc.  I leave that as an exercise for the reader.
		I merely share this code to illustrate a concept (using git from PoSH).

		Make sure you run as Administrator.  I didn't test this under any other security configuration.
		Don't forget: Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
